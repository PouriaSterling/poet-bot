This folder contains some example payloads for simulating Slack messages sent to the system.
They are meant as examples only, and are intended to demonstrate the general message structure.

To send the askProjectStatus message, run this from the project root:
   > serverless invoke local -f receptionist -p test/askProjectStatus.json
